============== NOTICE ABOUT POSSIBLE NON-FUNCTIONAL MODELS ===================

This folder contains many files which can be used to open the 3D model you requested. The folder will most likely contain the model as-extracted from many different games, so if you open the .blend file and it is non-functional, try the other .objs or MD5 meshes too! You should try them in this order:

>> OBJs, BLENDs and .Xs with no prelude are from PokePark Wii (i.e. Fushigidane.obj). Theise files are most reliable.
	Textures for this file are stored in the same folder as the model.
>> OBJs, BLENDs and .Xs that begin with BR_ are from Battle Revolutions. They are second most reliable
	Textures for theise files are stored in the /Textures/ folder in each model folder

============= HELP AND OTHER FILES =============

>> To open .x files in MMD, just click and drag them from the folder, onto the MMD workspace. It does work. Trust me.

>> .WAV files are audio files. Please don't try and use them in 3D modelling.

For more info on how to use theise files, please look at the tutorials I do to show you how BEFORE PM/EMAILing me. See my youtube at RootOfEvilStudios (http://www.youtube.com/user/RootOfEvilStudios) for tutorials and latest announcements.
